ML-Based Cache Project
Overview

This project focuses on implementing a Machine Learning (ML) based cache system with three different caching strategies: General Training Cache, Q-Learning based Cache, and Similarity-based Cache. 
The goal is to optimize cache performance and improve data retrieval efficiency in a variety of applications.
Features

    General Training Cache: A basic caching mechanism that stores frequently accessed data items in memory for faster retrieval.
    Q-Learning based Cache: Utilizes reinforcement learning techniques to optimize cache eviction policies based on historical access patterns.
    Similarity-based Cache: Uses similarity metrics to group and cache related data items, improving cache hit rates for similar queries.
